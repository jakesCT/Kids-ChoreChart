# Kids-ChoreChart

This is a project where I followed a great guide which can be read here https://community.home-assistant.io/t/created-a-chore-tracker-with-points-system-in-home-assistant/316175 
I played around with different ways to show the information as it's being displayed on a vertical screen much like a mobile device. I have this on 2 dashboards, they are identical except for 
one difference being the parents dashboard has the option of enabling and disabling extra chores which the kids dashboard does not have, this is the same for things like enabling wifi 
for their devices etc.
